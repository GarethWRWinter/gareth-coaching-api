# FORMA brand v2 — the design system

FORMA reads like print, not pixels: a chalk page, paper sheets laid on it, ink structure, one flamme accent, mono data. Bold Expanded type, hairline rules, flat surfaces, purposeful motion. The wordmark is FORMA followed by **the kite** — a flamme pennant full stop (never a round dot).

Canonical source: `frontend/docs/brand/FORMA-Brand-v2-source.html` (Gareth's brand doc) + delta map in `frontend/docs/brand/BRAND-V2-AUDIT.md`.

## The kite (the mark)

- CSS-drawn: `clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 50% 100%)`, always flamme, tip on the baseline. Utility `.f-kite` (size via `--kite`); components `FormaMark` (wordmark + kite) and `Kite`.
- Never an arrow, never rotated, never outlined, never any colour but flamme.
- Type inside the kite only at display sizes ≥64px.
- One kite moment per screen (list markers / sign-offs / page furniture count).

## The six inks (tokens in `frontend/src/app/globals.css` @theme, names `vb-*`)

- **Chalk** `#F0F0EC` — **THE PAGE.** `vb-bg`, the ground of every screen.
- **Paper** `#FAFAF7` — sheets laid on the page: cards, inputs, panels (`vb-surface`). White `#FFFFFF` = `vb-surface-raised` only.
- **Ink** `#0B0B0C` — text, strong rules, the wordmark. Dim `#55554F`, muted/slate `#9A9A94`.
- **Slate** `#9A9A94` — muted text, quiet data.
- **Carbon** `#101012` + raised `#1A1A1E` — ride mode / instrument surfaces only.
- **Flamme** `#FF3D00` (`vb-red`) — THE accent, one thing per screen. Bright `#FF5A2A`, dim `#D93400`.
- Borders: subtle `#ECEBE6`, hairline `#D8D8D2`, strong = ink. Recessed fills `vb-sunken` `#E7E7E1`.
- **Zone inks v2** z1→z7 (cold→hot): `#8E9196 #4A72AE #439D7C #D9AC34 #E86F22 #D92420 #B81743`. **Data colour only, never brand colour; flamme is not a zone.**
- Semantic: success `#439D7C`, warning `#D9AC34`.

## Type — three voices

- **The Announcer**: Archivo **Expanded** (`font-stretch: 125%`, loaded via next/font `axes: ["wdth"]`), weights 700–900 (`.f-display`). Headlines, the wordmark, numbers that shout. Never font-light at display sizes.
- **The Coach**: Inter Tight 400/500. Body, guidance, everything Forma says.
- **The Timekeeper**: IBM Plex Mono (`.f-kicker` eyebrows 11px/0.16em/uppercase; `.f-data` tabular-nums). Data is mono; trends are mono `▲▼` glyphs, never coloured pills.
- **Signature**: Caveat, flamme, only for Forma's handwritten sign-off (`.f-signature`).

## The coach — one Forma, two channels

Forma is the single coach (the DS). Two named channels, kept distinct:
- **Race Radio** — Forma's live voice *during a training session* (carbon ride player); terse, in-effort cues.
- **Coach Forma** — the *conversation off the bike* (nav: COACH); the memory-building, goal-working relationship.
Never rename the conversation "Race Radio" (reserved for the in-ride voice), and never add a second coach persona name — always Forma.

## The coach presence

Forma is a **flamme dot**, no avatar, no face, no disc. `CoachDot` in `components/ui/coach-glyph.tsx`:
- `still` (C1) — present, listening. `pulsing` (C2) — thinking/typing. `rippling` (C3) — speaking, **carbon surfaces only**.
- Legacy `CoachGlyph` import still works (renders the still dot centred in the old box).

## Brand imagery — the Abstract (ink-dispersion terrain)

The second imagery register beside hard photography: **iconic climbs rendered as ink-in-water abstractions** (exemplar: Sa Calobra, its 26 stacked switchbacks read as flow and sediment). Softer, editorial — for covers, chapter breaks, hero art and merch, not UI chrome.
- Lockup over the art: **chalk wordmark + flamme kite** (IB2, the approved treatment; all-chalk IB1 is the quiet fallback). Never ink-on-ink.
- The lockup sits in the **quiet corner**, clear of the busiest ink.
- Caption pattern: mono kicker, `SA CALOBRA · 26 BENDS`.
- Each piece stays in a limited palette (the Sa Calobra terrain is greens + subtle greys); one climb, one field, no collaging registers.

## Rules of composition ("print, not pixels")

- Flat. No shadows, no gradients, no glows. Radius 2px (sm) / 4px (md) max — never rounded-lg.
- Hairline borders separate; a 2px ink rule (`.f-rule`) opens sections.
- Flamme is scarce: one hot element per screen.
- Whitespace generous; editorial numbered sections (`01 ·`) only when content is truly sequential.
- Carbon (`.f-carbon`) reserved for the live ride player and ride-mode surfaces.
- Nav IA: **TODAY · COACH · RIDES · FORM · PLAN** (+ Brain, Goals, Settings as deeper rooms), mono single words.

## Motion (in globals.css, reduced-motion safe)

- `.f-rise` / `.f-stagger` entrance (fade + 12px rise, 60ms stagger).
- `.f-lift` hover (-2px + border-strong) for clickable cards; `.f-press` active scale.
- `.f-pulse-dot` flamme breathing for live elements; `.f-draw` rule wipe-in; coach dot states animate via `data-state`.
- `useCountUp` for data tiles. Motion is purposeful and brief, never decorative loops.

## Component kit (`frontend/src/components/ui/`)

`FormaMark` (wordmark + kite) · `Kite` · `CoachDot` (+legacy `CoachGlyph`) · `Button` (ink / flamme / ghost / quiet / carbon; mono uppercase; `Arrow` slides) · `Card` (`rail` = flamme left rail, `lift`) · `Kicker` · `SectionHeader` · `DataTile` (count-up, `hot` state, mono `▲▼` deltas) · `EmptyState` (Forma speaks + one CTA) · `ZoneChip` · `ProgressSteps` (mono numbers) · `CoachNote` (the canonical Forma-speaks block: rail + prose + Caveat signature) · `Badge` · `Input` · `Orb` (signed orb cutouts at editorial scale ≥120px, `.f-orb` float shadow, never behind a glow).

## Data-viz (`frontend/src/lib/palette.ts` — never hardcode data colours)

- `SERIES`: ink = primary line, grey = context, flamme = the story (TSB, actual-vs-plan), amber = HR, hairline grids. Thin strokes (1.5px), no area fills, mono tick labels.
- `ZONES` (v2 ramp) + `ZONE_BLOCKS` for intensity; `STEPS` for workout profiles; `BRAIN` for the memory graph (You=ink, Goals=flamme, Values=green, Habits=blue, Insights=gold, People=crimson, Rides=orange, Health=grey, Life=slate, Rules=carbon — all from the v2 ramp).

## Don'ts

The round-dot full stop (v1, dead — use the kite via `FormaMark`) · paper as the page ground (chalk is the page) · the v1 zone ramp (`#4A6FA5 #3E8E7E #D9A62E…`) · zone inks on brand surfaces · soft Scandi cards, forest green `#36513F`, clay `#BB6647`, linen `#F3F1EA` (ALMANAC is dead) · font-light display type · shadows/gradients · flamme everywhere · coloured trend pills (mono ▲▼ only) · centred body text walls · emoji in UI · coach avatars/faces (the coach is the dot).

For words, load the `forma-voice` skill. Fuller reference: the brand guidelines artifact (claude.ai/code/artifact/413c5b72-1247-4eed-9084-70ed9f58944e) + `frontend/docs/brand/`.
