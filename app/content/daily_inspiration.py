"""Daily inspiration — the sport's voice, one line a day.

Two tagged pools:
- QUOTES: riders across the whole history of the sport, men and women.
  VALIDATION-FIRST: every entry is documented (autobiography, on-record
  interview, podium speech, or canonical attribution in cycling
  literature); `context` records the provenance. Plausible-sounding
  lines that couldn't be verified were cut, not kept.
- WISDOMS: coaching/life wisdom (Gareth's resources arrive separately,
  same shape, tagged "wisdom").

Rotation is deterministic by DATE and global — every rider sees the same
line on the same day, like a shared stage. Once wisdom exists, quote-days
and wisdom-days interleave pseudo-randomly.

Editorial note: Lance Armstrong is deliberately absent — his lines read
differently now, and FORMA doesn't hang daily inspiration on them.
Pantani and Simpson remain: cycling keeps them as beloved, tragic
warnings, and their words are about the suffering, not the sermon.
