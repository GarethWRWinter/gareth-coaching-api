"""Memory taxonomy — the canonical entity types of Marco's brain.

The definitions below are LOAD-BEARING: they are rendered directly into the
extraction LLM's prompt (docstrings-are-prompts, per TIE Memory v2). The
"distinct from" prose is what makes classification accurate. Change these and
extraction behaviour changes — treat edits like prompt changes and eval them.

Rules of the taxonomy:
- Tags, not types: a subtype goes in `kind`, a new type only exists when it is
  extracted differently AND holds different data.
- Every entity carries `life_area` (training|body|mind|life) and `visibility`
  (private by default; health is never auto-surfaced).
- Plans are wiring, not a type — a plan is a traversal of a Goal's edges.
